# Project7-PCA-data-collection
The seventh semester data collection program. This program launches a GUI in which the researcher can choose from samples of which a participant will rate from 0-9.

# Guide
The program should require little to no fidgeting in use. Just press play and use the GUI to choos which samples from a csv file you want your participants to rate with the attributes from another CSV file. The choosing beer GUI does not scale with more than 10 samples but perhaps this will change in the future.

# Upgrades
These functions would be nice
- When trying to click next without having rated all attributes the program should signal that an attribute is missing
- Maybe an overhaul of looks
- A thank you screen
- A welcome screen in which the participant can try to use the scale.
- A counter for which number the beer is rated (is it the first or the fourth beer?)
- A counter for how many attributes have been rated. Maybe this fucks up data?
