# Project7-PCA-data-collection
The seventh semester data collection program.

# Guide
The program should require little to no fidgeting in use. Just press play and use the GUI to choos which samples from a csv file you want your participants to rate with the attributes from another CSV file. The choosing beer GUI does not scale with more than 10 samples but perhaps this will change in the future.
